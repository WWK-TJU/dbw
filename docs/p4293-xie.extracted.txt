ABSTRACT
We demonstrate MedHunter , a system for assisting the early stage
of drug development. MedHunter builds a biomedical knowledge
graph DDKG by integrating data from eleven biochemical libraries
and data banks, and aligning entities from different data sources
by means of heterogeneous entity resolution. It identifies drug-
disease associations and protein-protein interactions in DDKG by
employing graph association rules ( GARs ).GARs use graph pat-
terns to extract relevant entities and embed ML models as predi-
cates. MedHunter discovers GARs from DDKG and incrementally
enriches DDKG with external data; it cleans DDKG with a special
form of GARs . We demonstrate MedHunter for its (a) interfaces,
(b) data enrichment/cleaning, and (c) applications in target identifi-
cation, drug-drug interaction and protein-protein interaction.

1 INTRODUCTION
Drug discovery is the process of new drug identification, starting
from target selection and validation, through preclinical screening,
to clinical trials [ 13]. It is time-consuming and costly. The develop-
ment of a new drug takes 10–15 years, costs around 2 billion US
dollars, and typically has a high risk of failure (>90%) [22].
To accelerate drug discovery, reduce the cost and increase the
success rate, machine learning (ML) models have been explored to
identify drug-disease associations (DDAs), drug-drug interactions
(DDIs), and protein-protein interactions (PPIs). However, it is costly
to train accurate deep-learning models, and ML predictions often
have false positives (FPs) and false negatives (FNs). Moreover, ML
predictions “still lack reliable explanations that are crucial to drug

noise is introduced by “unavoidable inaccuracy” of the models, e.g.,
nonexistent relations and inaccurately named entities.
Can we do better? Is it possible to develop a cost-effective method
to reduce false positives and false negatives of ML predictions, and
moreover, enrich and clean the data from different data sources?
MedHunter (Section 2). In response to this, we have developed
a system to assist early drug discovery, known as MedHunter [1].
MedHunter aims to assist (1) target identification, to identify the
right biological molecules or cellular pathways that can be modu-
lated by drugs to achieve therapeutic benefits, in which PPIs are
often needed, (b) drug repurposing, to reuse existing drugs for a
new disease, and (c) ADR, to disclose undesirable impacts of drugs.
The need for these is evident. As an example, target identifica-
tion is perhaps the most crucial initial step in drug discovery, and
influences the chances of success at every step of drug development.
Traditional target identification easily takes from years to decades.
MedHunter helps select candidate targets and speed up the process.
Compared to ML models, MedHunter offers the following.
Graph association .MedHunter infers DDAs and DDIs from graphs
based on both ML predictions and logic deduction. It employs a class
of graph association rules ( GARs ) of the form 𝑄[¯𝑥](𝑋→𝑝0)[10].
Here𝑄is a graph pattern to extract related entities and their rela-
tionships/interactions; and 𝑋→𝑝0is a dependency on the entities.
Moreover, ML models may be embedded as predicates for link/node
classification. This allows MedHunter to directly leverage existing
ML models, and enhance their predictions with logical reasoning.
Accuracy and explanation .MedHunter deduces association 𝑝0as a
logical consequence of GARs with certainty [ 12], using accumulated
ground truth, i.e.,if the GARs and ground truth are correct, so is 𝑝0.
Moreover, it filters FPs and FNs of ML model Mby adding logic
predicates in precondition 𝑋. A PPI deduced by MedHunter in May
2022 coincides a finding published in Nature in the same month [ 17].
In addition, if 𝑝0is an ML modelMfor predicting DDIs, DDAs,
PPIs or ADR, we can discover pattern 𝑄and conditions 𝑋for rules
of the form 𝑄[¯𝑥](𝑋→M) to provide rational behind the predic-
tions ofM. This is possible for GNN-based models, which are no
more expressive than two-variable first-order logic with limited
counting [ 6,14]. Such interpretability is one of the key advantages
ofMedHunter . It enables researchers to get a glimpse of the inner

workings ofM, so as to make improvement with novel insights.
A uniform KG .MedHunter builds DDKG , a drug-disease knowl-
edge graph (KG) in which it discovers GARs and deduces DDAs,
DDIs and PPIs. DDKG consists of data from eleven libraries and data
banks, e.g.,CTD [ 3] and BioGrid [ 2]. It aligns entities from different
graphs [ 9], and incrementally enriches DDKG by external data [ 11].
Biomedical data cleaning .MedHunter cleans DDKG by employing
a special form of GARs [7]. It (incrementally) discovers such GARs ,
detects errors and fixes the errors in DDKG with the GARs .
Demonstration (Section 3). We give a guided tour of MedHunter ,
from rule discovery, rule deduction of DDAs, DDIs and PPIs, to
aligned entities in DDKG . Participants are invited to interact with
MedHunter and experience how it helps in DDAs, DDIs and PPIs.
2 AN OVERVIEW OF MEDHUNTER
This sections presents the association rules (Section 2.1), knowledge
graph (Section 2.2) and architecture (Section 2.3) of MedHunter .
2.1 Graph Association Deduction
MedHunter employs graph association rules ( GARs ). Graphs are
modeled as 𝐺=(𝑉,𝐸,𝐿,𝐹𝐴), where𝑉is a finite set of vertices;
𝐸⊆𝑉×𝐿(𝐸)×𝑉is a finite set of edges (𝑣,𝑙,𝑣′)with label𝑙; each𝑣
in𝑉is labeled with its “content” 𝐿(𝑣); and each vertex 𝑣∈𝑉carries
a tuple𝐹𝐴(𝑣)=(𝐴1=𝑎1,...,𝐴𝑛=𝑎𝑛)ofattributes of a finite arity.
GARs .GARs are defined with a pattern and a dependency. A graph
pattern is𝑄[¯𝑥]= (𝑉𝑄,𝐸𝑄,𝐿𝑄,𝜇), where (1) 𝑉𝑄(resp.𝐸𝑄) is a
finite set of vertices (resp. edges), (2) 𝐿𝑄assigns a label 𝐿𝑄(𝑢)
(resp.𝐿𝑄(𝑒)) to each pattern vertex 𝑢∈𝑉𝑄(resp. edge𝑒∈𝐸𝑄), (3)
¯𝑥is a list of distinct variables, and 𝜇is a bijective mapping from ¯𝑥to
𝑉𝑄,i.e.,it assigns a distinct variable to each vertex 𝑣in𝑉𝑄. For𝑥∈¯𝑥,
we use𝜇(𝑥)and𝑥interchangeably when it is clear in the context.
Amatch of pattern𝑄[¯𝑥]in graph𝐺is a homomorphism ℎfrom
𝑄to𝐺such that (a) for each 𝑢∈𝑉𝑄,𝐿𝑄(𝑢)=𝐿(ℎ(𝑢)); and (b) for
each𝑒=(𝑢,𝑙,𝑢′)in𝑄,𝑒′=(ℎ(𝑢),𝑙,ℎ(𝑢′))is an edge in 𝐺.
Apredicate of pattern𝑄[¯𝑥]is one of the following:
𝑝::=𝑙(𝑥,𝑦)|𝑥.𝐴⊗𝑦.𝐵|𝑥.𝐴⊗𝑐|2WL𝐿(𝑥,𝑦,𝑙)|M(𝑥.¯𝐴,𝑦. ¯𝐵),
where⊗is one of =,≠,<,≤,>,≥;𝑥and𝑦are variables in ¯𝑥;𝑐is a
constant;𝐴and𝐵are attributes; and 𝑥.¯𝐴is a list of attributes at
“vertex”𝑥; similarly for 𝑦.¯𝐵. We support (a) link predicate 𝑙(𝑥,𝑦),
indicating the existence of an edge labeled 𝑙from vertex 𝑥to𝑦; (b)
attribute predicates 𝑥.𝐴⊗𝑦.𝐵and𝑥.𝐴⊗𝑐to compare attribute values;
(c)2WL𝐿(𝑥,𝑦,𝑙), to check whether there is a link of “type” (label) 𝑙
from𝑥to𝑦by local 2-WL (Weisfieler-Leman) test [ 15] (see below);
and (d) ML predicateM(𝑥.¯𝐴,𝑦. ¯𝐵)returns true iffMpredicts true at
(𝑥.¯𝐴,𝑦. ¯𝐵); hereMis an ML model that returns Boolean ( e.g.,M≥
𝜎if the strength of the Mprediction is above a predefined bound 𝜎).
Agraph association rule (GAR )𝜑is defined as
𝑄[¯𝑥](𝑋→𝑝0),
where𝑄[¯𝑥]is a graph pattern, 𝑋is a (possibly empty) conjunction
of predicates of 𝑄[¯𝑥], and𝑝0is a predicate of 𝑄[¯𝑥]. We refer to
𝑄[¯𝑥]and𝑋→𝑝0as the pattern anddependency of𝜑, respectively,
and to𝑋and𝑝0as the precondition andconsequence , respectively.
Intuitively, the pattern 𝑄extracts related entities in a graph,
and the dependency 𝑋→𝑝0is applied to the entities. Attribute
Figure 1: Graph patterns in GARs
predicates𝑥.𝐴=𝑐and𝑥.𝐴=𝑦.𝐵specify value associations of
attributes, and link predicates 𝑙(𝑥,𝑦)make link associations . One can
“plug in” pre-trained ML models Mfore.g.,ER and classification.
Predicate 2WL𝐿(𝑥,𝑦,𝑙)is used to explain the predictions of M.
As shown in [ 15], most GNN models for link prediction are based
on the 1-WL test, and are at most as expressive as local 2-WL test.
Thus with 2WL𝐿(𝑥,𝑦,𝑙),GARs can explain such GNN predictions.
Below we exemplify GARs discovered from real-life data.
(1) Drug repurposing . Upon the request of our biomedical partners,
MedHunter was used to discover GARs for repositioning of existing
drugs on a type of Parkinson disease. A GAR is𝜑1=𝑄1[¯𝑥](𝑋1→
𝑙(𝑥0,𝑥1))in Figure 1. The rule is discovered from CTD [ 3]. Together
with𝑄1, precondition 𝑋1specifies the following: (1) drug 𝑥0has a
known effect on an inborn genetic blood disease 𝑥2; (2) disease𝑥1is
the Parkinson; (3) drug 𝑥0interacts with a gene 𝑥3, which shares an
effect pathway 𝑥4with𝑥1; (4) drug𝑥0can interact with a gene 𝑥5,
which has anM1-predicted relationship with 𝑥1(the dashed arrow
in𝑄1), whereM1is a model that predicts the associations between
genes and diseases [ 18,20,21]; and (5) drug 𝑥0has a known effect
on a type of skin cancer 𝑥6, which shares an effect pathway with
𝑥1. The predicted link 𝑙(𝑥0,𝑥1)(the bold line in 𝑄1) indicates that
drug𝑥0may be associated to Parkinson’s disease 𝑥1in some way.
Such GARs found five drugs for Parkinson, four with published
evidence and the remaining one is under lab investigation.
(2) Protein-protein interaction .BioGRID [2] is a popular biomedical
repository. After enriching it with external data, e.g.,UniProt [5], a
GAR is𝜑2=𝑄2[¯𝑥](M 2(𝑥0,𝑥0)≥𝛿∧𝑋2→𝑙(𝑥0,𝑥0)), in whichM2
is aRGCN model [ 19] for PPIs,𝑄2is given in Figure 1 in which each
vertex (resp. edge) denotes a protein (resp. PPI); here 𝑋2specifies
logic conditions e.g.,the domains and subcellular locations. This
GAR identifies the self-interaction 𝑙(𝑥0,𝑥0)(the bold loop in 𝑄2) on
𝑥0by filtering the FPs of the prediction of M2with additional logic
conditions in 𝑋2,i.e.,although the strength of the M2prediction is
above the threshold 𝛿, the prediction is made only if 𝑋2holds.
A PPI identified by such GARs coincides a finding in [17].
(3) Explanation . If𝑝0is an ML predicate, MedHunter can discover
GARs to explain the ML prediction, e.g.,𝜑3=𝑄3[¯𝑥](𝑋3→M 3(𝑥0,
𝑥4))in Figure 1, where M3is an ML model that predicts the in-
teraction between gene 𝑥0and disease 𝑥4. This GAR explains why
M3(𝑥0,𝑥4)is true (the bold line in 𝑄3) with both𝑄3and𝑋3,i.e.,(1)
gene𝑥0has interacted with pathway 𝑥2; (2) gene𝑥0has interacted
with disease 𝑥1that has also interacted with pathway 𝑥3; (3) gene𝑥5
is predicted to interact with pathway 𝑥3by2WL𝐿, and it has effect
on disease𝑥4; and (4) pathway 𝑥2has effect on diseases 𝑥1and𝑥4.

Algorithms .MedHunter implements (a) the algorithm of [ 8] for
discovering GARs , (b) an extension of [ 12] for deducing missing
DDIs, DDAs and PPIs; it chases a biomedical graph with a set Σof
mined GARs by accumulating and referencing ground truth in the
process. Both algorithms are parallely scalable, i.e.,they provably
guarantee to reduce runtime when given more processors [16].
2.2 Cleaning and Enriching DDKG
MedHunter maintains DDKG by enriching and cleaning its data.
Drug-Disease Knowledge Graph .DDKG integrates biomedical
libraries and data banks, by computing their join as follows.
MedHunter aligns entities across different graphs by employing
heterogeneous entity resolution ( HER ) [9]. For a vertex 𝑣1in graph
𝐺1and vertex𝑣2in another graph 𝐺2, it determines whether 𝑣1
and𝑣2refer to the same entity via parametric simulation, which
embeds ML models for similarity checking in topological matching.
Given𝐺1=(𝑉1,𝐸1,𝐿1,𝐹1)and𝐺2=(𝑉2,𝐸2,𝐿2,𝐹2),MedHunter
“joins” them as 𝐺⊕(𝐺1,𝐺2)=(𝑉⊕,𝐸⊕,𝐿⊕,𝐹⊕), where𝑉⊕(resp.𝐸⊕)
is a revision of the union 𝑉1∪𝑉2(resp.𝐸∪𝐸2) such that𝑢and𝑣are
represented as the same (merged) vertex in 𝑉⊕if(𝑢,𝑣)is a match
byHER ; and𝐿⊕and𝐹⊕inherit the label and attribute assignments
from𝐺1and𝐺2. When𝑢and𝑣both carry attribute 𝐴, the merged
vertex takes the value 𝑣.𝐴from more reliable 𝐺𝑖(∈[1,2]).
Data enrichment . To ensure that DDKG remains up-to-date and
relevant, MedHunter continuously and incrementally enriches it in
response to updates Δ𝐺to the source graphs. Rather than adding
all data from Δ𝐺, it employs the graph filtering method of [ 11]
to extract only relevant data to DDKG ; it applies LSTM to pick
“important” paths ranks the paths, extracts data from top-ranked
paths, and enriches DDKG with the data. As shown in [ 11], graph
filtering is effective in reducing noise and the size of DDKG .
Data cleaning .MedHunter maintains the quality of DDKG via
a (human-in-the-loop) cleaning procedure, using a special case of
GARs , referred to as Graph Cleaning Rules ( GCRs ) [7]. AGCR has a
formQ[𝑥0,𝑦0](𝑋→𝑝0), whereQ[𝑥0,𝑦0]=⟨𝑄𝑥[𝑥0,¯𝑥],𝑄𝑦[𝑦0,¯𝑦]⟩,
𝑄𝑥[𝑥0,¯𝑥]is a star shape pattern with a designed 𝑥0; similarly for
𝑄𝑦[𝑦0,¯𝑦].GCRs support all the predicates of GARs except 2WL𝐿.
Intuitively,Qspecifies two entities 𝑥0and𝑦0with heterogeneous
structures in a schemaless graph. The star patterns identify features
of𝑥0and𝑦0. We restrict 𝑄𝑥and𝑄𝑦to a star shape so that it takes
polynomial time to check matches of such Q, and to apply GCRs [7].
MedHunter automatically discovers GCRs from DDKG . To cleandata with certain fixes, users can selectively apply a set of GCRs
based on labeled ground-truth data; they may optionally intervene
in a prompt-and-confirm style to facilitate the cleaning process.
Algorithms .MedHunter implements (a) the algorithms of [ 11] for
graph join, data enrichment, and incremental discovery of GARs ;
(b) the algorithms of [ 7] for mining GCRs and detecting errors;
and (c) an extension of the algorithm of [ 12] for fixing the detected
errors. All the algorithms are also parallelly scalable [16].
2.3 The Architecture of MedHunter
The architecture of MedHunter is shown in Figure 2. It consists of
the following main modules, from the bottom to the top.
◦Data sources , which maintain raw data from various libraries and
data banks. New data can be dynamically merged with DDKG .
◦Data enrichment . On top of the data source module, MedHunter
conducts data enrichment, by first aligning entities across differ-
ent sources and then leveraging graph join and graph filtering
techniques to construct a unified knowledge graph DDKG .
◦Rule discovery and data cleaning . Based on the integrated DDKG ,
MedHunter supports GAR /GCR discovery, cleaning and associ-
ation deduction, in both batch and incremental modes. before.
◦Applications . The GARs discovered are then used in various
biomedical applications, for identifying DDAs, DDIs and PPIs,
3 DEMONSTRATION SETUP AND PLAN
This section proposes our plan for demonstrating MedHunter1.
Setup . We will use a single machine powered by 16GB RAM and 8
processors with Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 5320 CPU @2.20GH.
User interface . Participants are invited to access MedHunter from
its Web UI. As shown in the snapshot of Figure 3, MedHunter
presents a friendly interface. The top navigation bar provides access
to three main modules of MedHunter . Each module is task-based,
and it takes only a few clicks to get a task up and running. We
will walk users through the process of creating new tasks, where
they configure inputs and monitor its progress. The task results are
visualized and updated in real time through the dashboard.
Data enrichment . We will give a guided tour of how MedHunter
enriches DDKG from external data, e.g.,PharmGKB [ 4]. User can
“join” data and DDKG , and take the enriched DDKG for further anal-
ysis. The process is interactive and visualized on the Web interface.

Data cleaning . We will walk users through the data cleaning pro-
cess of MedHunter . We will guide users to configure and run rule
discovery for GCRs . The users can examine the discovered GCRs ,
and pick a subset for cleaning. We will demonstrate interactive data
cleaning, using the selected GCRs . During the process, MedHunter
will visualize detected errors and the GCRs , with suggested fixes. A
user may opt to either accept a suggestion or customize a fix, which
will be taken as ground truth for subsequent GCR applications.
Applications . Participants are also invited to experience drug
discovery with MedHunter , in the following three scenarios. Each
scenario is offered as a task template under rule discovery.
Scenario 1: DDAs . Users may pick a disease 𝑦, and identify either
(a) molecule targets or (b) existing drugs that may have therapeutic
effects on the disease. It is to discover and apply GARs whose
consequence has the form 𝑙(𝑥,𝑦), where𝑥is a drug or a gene. Over
DDKG , we will direct users to specify 𝑦in the task template for
GAR discovery and monitor its execution. The discovered GARs
and their predicted DDAs are visualized and updated in real time.
A learned GAR𝜑4=𝑄4[¯𝑥](𝑥2.NVIP≥3∧𝑥3.Nanno<125→
𝑙(𝑥2,𝑥1))is shown in the left panel of Figure 4. It suggests that a
drug𝑥2may be associated to disease 𝑥1, provided that (1) 𝑥2has a
high VIP count ( i.e.,an active compound), and (2) 𝑥1and𝑥2both
interact with a gene variant 𝑥3that has a low annotation count
(<125).MedHunter reports that GAR𝜑4has a support of 51, with
confidence over 0.95. One of its predicted DDAs is between Drug
#PA128406956 and Disease #PA445742 (shown in the right panel).
Scenario 2: DDIs .MedHunter can also disclose drug-drug interac-
tions. We will demonstrate this functionality in a procedure similar
to DDAs, except that it allows users to specify a target drug as 𝑦.
Scenario 3: PPIs . The participants will also witness how MedHunter
identifies protein-protein interactions. It is to discover and apply
link predicting GARs over the PPI network of DDKG , along with
ML models for PPI predictions, e.g.,RGCN. We will guide the users
to examine the result as GARs focus on reducing the FPs and FNs.
Figure 5 shows a discovered GAR𝜑5=𝑄5[¯𝑥](𝑥1.pathway =
Metabolism _of_proteins∧𝑥1.domain =Cyclin∧M 2(𝑥1,𝑥1)=
false→𝑙(𝑥1,𝑥1)). The rule’s confidence is 0.993; it suggests the self-
PPI on protein 𝑥1despite the negative prediction of M2, if (1) Cyclin-
domain𝑥1is involved in the pathway “Metabolism of proteins”,
and (2)𝑥1shares at least two common PPIs with protein 𝑥2.
